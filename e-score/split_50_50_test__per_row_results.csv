"Perform sentiment analysis on the given review of ""Aniara"". On one level this movie is a success. It's an engaging, non-commercial Sci-fi film that is well acted, directed and produced. It held my attention and made me want to find out the fate of the ship and crew. I knew nothing of the poem. I knew nothing other than what the trailer contained. It is incredibly difficult to adapt a poem which is tied more than any other literary form to the word, into a mostly visual medium. Since the screenwriter seemed to jettison the words of the poem what we are left with is an outline. That's where some problems begin. The poem was written in 1956, when space travel hadn't even started. So, it's pretty lame when a space ship the size of the Aniara doesn't have redundant power and a number of backup plans for when/if things go wrong. But hey, we're already in outer space, disbelief is suspended, so, shut the hell up. There's a bunch character driven scenes but none of character ever develop. The really all stay the same no matter what they've been through. Also Instead of a fully developed story we get inundated with a series of let downs which really come off as more of a drag than tragic. I mean would it really be that bad to be traveling through space? The filmmakers certainly seem sure it is. There's some poignant moments throughout, to be sure. The problem is it's all for a movie that just peters out. What may have had great resonance on the page doesn't make it through the translation to screen. I think if they had stronger conclusion to what happens to the main character at the end the movie would've worked better. That way the ultimate ending would've become a post script. That didn't happen, so we're left with a movie that just stops on some sort of note about 'the vastness of space'. All this makes 'Aniara' unsatisfying even though it's well done on many levels.","Overall, the sentiment of the review is mixed. The reviewer acknowledges the movie as a success for its non-commercial Sci-fi genre, well-acted performances, and engagement factor. However, the review also highlights some limitations of the movie, including the adaptation of the poem, character development, and the lack of a satisfactory conclusion. The reviewer ends the review by calling ""Aniara"" unsatisfying, despite its well-made aspects.","Perform sentiment analysis on the given review of ""Aniara"". On one level this movie is a success.

"Take a given set of facts and create a creative story with it. The sun was setting, the sky was pink and there was a beach with a lighthouse in the distance.","Once upon a time, on a calm and serene evening, the sun began its descent towards the horizon, painting the sky in a soft shade of pink. The gentle sounds of the waves filled the air, as they crashed against the pristine sands of the beach. In the distance, a lighthouse stood tall and proud, a beacon of hope and guidance for the seafarers who journeyed through the treacherous waters. As the sky darkened, the light from the lighthouse illuminated the surroundings, casting a warm glow on everything it touched. A couple strolling along the beach, hand in hand, stopped to marvel at the beauty of the moment. The sunset, the beach, and the lighthouse in the distance, all came together to create a picture-perfect scene, one that they would never forget. The lighthouse had stood there for as long as anyone could remember, a silent witness to countless sunsets and sunrises. It had weathered many storms and had always remained steadfast, a symbol of resilience and perseverance. And as the sun disappeared completely, leaving behind a starry night sky, the lighthouse continued to shine its light, a constant reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope.","Take a given set of facts and create a creative story with it.

Write a story that features a character whose life changed dramatically because of a dream.,"Once upon a time, there was a man named John who lived a simple life in a small town. He worked at the local factory and spent his evenings at home, content with his routine. However, one night, John had a vivid dream that would change the course of his life forever. In the dream, he found himself standing on a stage, with thousands of people cheering his name. He was a successful musician, traveling the world and sharing his music with people from all walks of life. When he woke up, the feelings of excitement and fulfillment stayed with him; he couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant for something more. John had always loved music but had thought it was just a hobby, something to pass the time. However, after the dream, he realized that he had a true passion and talent for it. He began to devote his time to writing and performing, playing at local venues and gradually building a following. Word of his talent spread, and eventually, he caught the attention of a record label. They offered him a contract, and before he knew it, John was living the life of his dreams. He toured the world and shared his music with millions of fans, just as he had in his dream. John never forgot the way that one dream changed the trajectory of his life. It gave him the courage to pursue his passion and opened doors he never thought possible.

And with the Earth's problems mounting, one woman decided it was time to leave it all behind and start a new life on a distant planet. Her name was Ana, a brave and determined woman who had lost everything in her life. She lost her job, her home, and her family to the numerous natural disasters and economic problems that plagued the world. She longed for something new, an adventure, a chance to start anew. So when she saw the advertisement for a new colony on a distant planet, she jumped at the opportunity. She sold everything she had left and bought a one-way ticket to the far reaches of space. The journey was long and arduous, but Ana remained determined. She was awed by the vast expanse of the universe and the beauty of the stars she passed by. As she settled into her tiny cabin aboard the ship, she dreamed of the life that awaited her on the distant planet. After months of travel, the ship finally arrived at its destination. Ana's heart leapt as she gazed upon the vibrant green planet. It was everything she had ever hoped for: lush forests, crystal-clear rivers, and rolling hills that stretched as far as the eye could see. She stepped off the ship and took her first breath of the fresh air. It was sweeter and purer than anything she had tasted on Earth. The colonists worked hard to build their new homes and plant their first crops. Ana made friends with the other brave souls who had made the same journey as her. Eventually, she had her own home, a small farm, and a community of like-minded people who shared her dreams of starting anew. She never looked back and knew that she had made the best decision of her life. Ana's story was only the beginning.

It was a small, blue box, humming and glowing with an otherworldly light. She approached it slowly, her curiosity pulling her closer despite her apprehension. As she reached out to touch the box, she felt a burst of energy running through her. The box began to hover and spin, and she stumbled back, unsure of what to do. As she watched, the box opened, and a small creature emerged, its wings fluttering as it hovered in front of her. It looked like no creature she had ever seen before, with its big green eyes and fur as soft as a cloud. The creature seemed to look at her with understanding and spoke to her in a language she couldn't comprehend. She reached out to touch the creature, and it nuzzled into her hand. She felt a sense of peace and wonder wash over her. The creature then flew away, its wings leaving a trail of sparkling dust behind it. Shaking her head in disbelief, she continued on her way home, her mind reeling with the encounter she had just experienced.

They often heard stories about the wonders and mysteries that lay within the forest, and they dreamed of one day exploring it for themselves. One sunny day, the friends decided that the time had come to finally venture into the forest. They packed a bag with food and water, and set off on their adventure. As they walked deeper into the forest, they discovered that the stories they had heard were true. The trees were tall and twisted, with leaves that shimmered in the sunlight. Flowers bloomed in vibrant colors, and the air was thick with the sweet scent of wild honey. As they walked, Alfie, Lucy, and Mark heard the gentle sound of running water. They followed the sound and discovered a crystal-clear stream that flowed through the heart of the forest. They knelt down to drink from the stream, and the water tasted sweeter than anything they had ever tasted before. As they continued their journey, the friends came across creatures they had never seen before. There were rabbits with wings, and birds that glowed in the dark. There were tiny dragons that breathed puffs of smoke, and mischievous fairies that danced around the friends, giggling and whispering. Alfie, Lucy, and Mark explored the magical forest for hours, discovering new wonders around every corner. As the sun began to set, they realized it was time to head back to the village. They promised each other that they would return to the forest to explore its wonders once again. From that day on, the friends returned to the magical forest whenever they could.

Max was a curious and adventurous soul, always eager to learn and explore. One day, Max overheard some seniors talking about a mysterious book that was rumored to be hidden deep within the confines of the town library. This book was said to be so powerful that whoever possessed it would be granted immense knowledge and wisdom. Max could not resist the temptation to find this enigmatic book and set out on a quest to uncover its secrets. The Storyville library was a grand and imposing building, with tall columns and long corridors that seemed to go on forever. Max felt a thrill of excitement as he entered the library, the musky scent of old books and polished wood filling his nostrils. He began his search on the ground floor, scanning the shelves and rummaging through dusty cabinets. But alas, the mysterious book was nowhere to be found. Undeterred, Max ventured to the upper floors, his heart beating faster with every step. The library seemed to grow darker and more labyrinthine as he climbed higher, the shadows deepening and the air growing colder. Soon, Max found himself standing before a towering bookcase, its shelves groaning under the weight of ancient tomes and forgotten manuscripts. He felt a shiver run down his spine, as if he were standing on the threshold of another world. With trembling hands, Max reached out and took hold of a thick, leather-bound volume. He pulled it gently from the shelf and blew away the dust that clung to its pages. As he opened the book, he felt a rush of wonder and excitement. The pages were filled with mysterious symbols and arcane diagrams, the secrets of the universe laid bare before him. And so, Max's quest came to an end.

A 5-year-old boy who loves to ask questions but hates following rules,"Once there was a little boy named Timmy. At just five years old, he was full of energy and curiosity. He loved to explore the world around him and would ask anyone and everyone any questions that came to mind. His thirst for knowledge was insatiable, and his parents were happy to see him so eager to learn. However, Timmy had one flaw that often got him into trouble. He hated following rules. No matter how many times he was told what to do, he would always find a way to bend, break, or completely ignore them. Whether it was in school, at home, or out in public, Timmy was always pushing boundaries and testing the limits. At first, his parents and teachers found his rebelliousness amusing, but as time went on, they realized it was becoming a real problem. They tried everything they could think of to get him to follow the rules, but nothing seemed to work. Timmy didn't understand why there were so many silly and unnecessary rules to follow, and he didn't see the harm in breaking them. But one day, Timmy's disobedience almost cost him his life. He was at the park with his friends when he saw a sign that read ""Do Not Enter."" Without thinking twice, he ignored the warning and climbed over the fence. He didn't understand that the sign was there to keep him safe from the construction zone on the other side. It was only by chance that a construction worker saw him and quickly pulled him out of harm's way. After the near-miss, Timmy's parents sat him down and explained the importance of following rules. They told him that rules are there to keep him and others safe, and that even though he may not always agree with them, it was important to follow them. It took some time, but eventually, Timmy came to understand the wisdom of their words. From then on, Timmy started following rules more closely. He still had the same spirit of curiosity and adventurousness, but now he knew how to balance it with responsibility. He grew up to be a brave, intelligent, and kind young man, who was loved and respected by all who knew him.","Create a story arc that introduces a character given a short description.

"Goal: Let there be a right triangle with sides a, b and c, where c is the hypotenuse. h is the height drawn from the right angle to c and splits the hypotenuse to ca (segment connected to the side a) and cb (segment connected to the side b). As Euclid stated, when given the hypotenuse length c and the length of one of the hypotenuse segments cb, it is possible to determine the length of all sides and of the height, by using this formula: h2 = ca * cb By using this formula and/or any other formulas of your choice, calculate the length of the two remaining sides (a and b) and the height (h) of the triangle.

Then, we can solve for the height h using h2 = ca * cb. Here is the Python code to solve this problem: ``` import math input_str = input() try: c, cb = map(int, input_str.split()) except ValueError: print(""INCORRECT"") else: if c <= 0 or cb <= 0 or cb >= c: print(""INCORRECT"") else: ca = c - cb a = math.sqrt(c ** 2 - cb ** 2) b = math.sqrt(c ** 2 - ca ** 2) h = math.sqrt(ca * cb) print(""{:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f}"".format(a, b, h)) ``` We first parse the input string into integers c and cb using `map` and `split`. We then check if the input is valid, i.e., if c and cb are positive and cb is less than c. If the input is valid, we solve for ca, a, b, and h using the equations described above, and print them out with two decimal places using the format string `""{:.2f}""`.","Goal: Let there be a right triangle with sides a, b and c, where c is the hypotenuse. h is the height drawn from the right angle to c and splits the hypotenuse to ca (segment connected to the side a) and cb (segment connected to the side b).

Explanation:

Let there be a right triangle with two sides a, b and c and a segment ca, bc. There is a right angle (segment connected to the side c) of length ca and a segment cb (segment connected to the side b). To find the hypotenuse of this triangle, first find the segment cb:

So what exactly is Machine Learning?

The most popular term, of course, is Artificial Intelligence. It's a subset of Artificial Intelligence, but not the same thing.

The mean is calculated by summing all numbers and dividing by the total count. So, mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) / 10 = 5.5. 3. To find the equation of a line, use the slope-intercept form: y = mx + b. The slope (m) is (change in y) / (change in x) = (-2 - 3) / (4 - 1) = -5/3. Using (1,3) as a point and substituting m and (x,y), we get: 3 = (-5/3)(1) + b. Solving for b, we get b = 14/3.

Write a story about given scene. Scene: An old farmer walking in a field that has been burned to the ground.,"As the sun slowly set, an old farmer walked through a field that had been burned to the ground. The remnants of his once lush and green farm were charred and black, leaving an ashen landscape in its wake. The farmer looked down at the ground, his heart heavy with both sorrow and anger. For as long as he could remember, the farmer had lived on this land. He had inherited the farm from his father and had worked hard to keep it thriving. But disaster had struck one dry summer when a wildfire ripped through the valley, ravaging everything in its path. The farmer had done everything he could to save his crops and livestock, but the fire proved too powerful. Now, as he walked through the ruins of his farm, the old farmer felt a sense of hopelessness. The land that had once supported him and his family was now barren and lifeless. Tears streamed down his wrinkled face as he thought about the years he had dedicated to this land, only for it to be taken away in an instant. But as the old farmer continued to walk through the burned field, he began to notice something. Here and there, tiny green shoots were sprouting up through the ash. A glimmer of hope began to shine through his despair. Perhaps the land was not completely destroyed after all. With renewed determination, the farmer made a decision. He would begin again. He would rebuild his farm and watch as new life sprung forth from the ashes. It would be a long and difficult road, but the old farmer was not one to give up without a fight. And so, as the sun disappeared below the horizon, the old farmer walked towards his home, his heart filled with hope for the future. The land that had been burned to the ground would rise again, stronger than ever before.","Write a story about given scene.

He lived in a small village at the foot of a mountain, where he tended to the goats that roamed the mountainside. Every day, he would lead them up the rocky paths to the lush meadows where they could graze on the wild grasses, and then back to the village at night.

There, he found a wounded dragon, its scales glinting in the sun.
